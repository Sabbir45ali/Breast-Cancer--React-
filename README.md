# Breast Cancer Detection Website

This project is a web application designed to assist in detecting breast cancer using machine learning models and image classification. The application uses Vite with React for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS. The backend integrates two powerful models: a Fandom Forest model for data-based prediction and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience on all devices.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: 
  - **Fandom Forest Model**: Processes user input data to predict the likelihood of breast cancer.
  - **CNN Model**: Performs image classification on mammogram reports.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and clear form fields for user input.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures user data is processed securely and confidentially.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays prediction results and model performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
